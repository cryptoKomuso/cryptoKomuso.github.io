			Hello and thanks for stopping by. <br/>
			<br/>
			My name is K and I've been in crypto since 2016 when I bought my first Eth. I survived the DAO hack, hedl through the bear markets. In May '21 I became a crypto millionaire. In June, just after my 39th birthday I got hacked and lost everything. I fell into despair and hit the bottom.<br/>
			<br/>
			Crypto space is full of stories of success. Of riches made over short time by dilligent investors or degenerate gamblers. Early retirements and lambos to the moon.<br/>
			<br/>
			I didn't care about becoming wealthy, just wanted to be better off. To have enough to live modestly, help out my family and friends and open a bussiness, a hostel. And when I arrived there I failed due to a simple human error of not being careful enough. The protocol doesn't care.
			<br/>
			<br/>Here I am left with nothing. Yet I still believe cryptos are an amazing invention and I don't want to leave the space. All I want is to get back a small fraction of what I lost - 33 ETH. I guess I am a true believer.<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
			In reality for every person who gets rich there is another one that gets annihilated. You won't hear about those often as the moonboy echochamber doesn't care. This is a zero sum game and and it is swarming with malicious actors who destroy others on an industrial scale.<br/><br/>
